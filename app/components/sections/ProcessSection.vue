/**
 * How I work — the site's third axis: DEPTH.
 *
 * The cards do not scroll past each other; they stack towards the viewer.
 * Each card is `position: sticky`, so it holds at the top of the viewport while
 * the next one scrolls up to meet it. GSAP then scales, dims and tips each card
 * backwards as it gets buried.
 *
 * WHY `sticky` AND NOT MORE PINNING
 * We already pin the Work section. Pinning several sections in a row means
 * several ScrollTriggers all inserting spacer elements, and they compound
 * measurement errors. Native `position: sticky` costs nothing, never needs
 * re-measuring, and survives a resize on its own. Reach for CSS first; use
 * ScrollTrigger for the parts CSS genuinely cannot do — here, the scaling.
 *
 * The `rotateX` is what sells it as depth rather than as a scale animation: the
 * card tips away from you, so its top edge recedes.
